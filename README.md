# Custom-dev-console
## How does it work?
It uses Roblox's LogService API to collect all logs, errors, and warnings.

## How does it work with tables?
I've integrated hookfunction() to override the default print, warn, and error functions, converting tables into JSON strings.

<ins> feel free to modify it. i will try to update it regularly </ins>


# <b> WORKS ONLY WITH EXECUTORS THAT SUPPORT hookfunction() </b>
